# FastMusic
FastMusic is an Android music player for those who prefers simplicity and performance.
<br>
This is an alpha stage software, please do not expect too many features (for now). I'm learning Android and trying to build a working project as soon as possible, so code might not be perfect at this time.
<br>
<br>
FastMusic is also on Google Play Store if you want to test alpha builds.

This project is built from ground up by myself but I used experience I gained from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/okrt/CevikMuzik">CevikMuzik</a>, which I developed with my friends as a school project.
